# RNASeq Data Analysis

This era gives researchers opportunity to use parallel sequencing for routine experiments and produce exponential amount of data. The RNASeq is widely used technique to study gene expression, alternative splicing, de nova transcripts discovery, functional annotation and understanding different biological pathways.

This RNASeq Data Analysis worlkflow is based on folllwing researh paper with few changes: 

Griffith M, Walker JR, Spies NC, Ainscough BJ, Griffith OL (2015) Informatics for RNA Sequencing: A Web Resource for Analysis on the Cloud. PLoS Comput Biol 11(8): e1004393. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004393

The RNA sequencing data consists of two commercially available RNA samples: Universal Human Reference (UHR) and Human Brain Reference (HBR). The UHR is total RNA isolated from a varied set of 10 cancer cell lines. The HBR is total RNA isolated from the brain cells. The RNA sequencing data is sequenced on a HiSeq 2000 machine using paired end with read length of 100bp.
