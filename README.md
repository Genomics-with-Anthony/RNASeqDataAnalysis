# RNASeq Data Analysis

This era gives researchers opportunity to use parallel sequencing for routine experiments and produce exponential amount of data. The RNASeq is widely used technique to study gene expression, alternative splicing, de nova transcripts discovery, functional annotation and understanding different biological pathways.

This RNASeq Data Analysis workflow is based on folllwing researh paper with few changes: 

Griffith M, Walker JR, Spies NC, Ainscough BJ, Griffith OL (2015) Informatics for RNA Sequencing: A Web Resource for Analysis on the Cloud. PLoS Comput Biol 11(8): e1004393. doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004393

Please be aware that this RNASeq Data Analysis workflow is build to give you general idea on how different tools can be combined to perform analysis so this workflow can't be used to all kind of datasets. You need to optimize tools and their parameters according to the available dataset.
